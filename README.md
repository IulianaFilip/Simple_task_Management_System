# Simple_task_Management_System
Create a command-line task management system that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks should have a title, description, status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed"), and a due date. The system should provide a menu-driven interface for users to interact with.
