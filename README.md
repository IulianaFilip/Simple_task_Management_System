# Simple_task_Management_System
Create a command-line task management system that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks should have a title, description, status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed"), and a due date. The system should provide a menu-driven interface for users to interact with.
Requirements:

User should be able to create a new task by providing the necessary details.
User should be able to view all tasks, displaying their titles and statuses.
User should be able to view the details of a specific task by entering its title.
User should be able to update the status and due date of a task.
User should be able to delete a task by entering its title.
The system should validate user input and handle errors gracefully.
The tasks should be stored in a file or a database, allowing persistence between program executions.
